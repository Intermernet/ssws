{"name":"ssws","tagline":"Simple Static Web Server","body":"###ssws is a Simple Static Web Server written in [Go][1]###\r\n\r\nIt's suitable for simple testing of html, css and javascript on your local machine. You can also use it for demonstrating ideas or mockups without a net connection, as a simple, single binary replacement to things like [Python's][2] `SimpleHTTPServer`, or just to play around with web development.\r\n\r\nFor more serious use, because it's so simple (59 lines of code), and written in [Go's][1] standard libraries, it should be quite reliable and performant, and may be a good choice as a static file server behind a proxy.\r\n\r\nIt has 4 optional flags:\r\n\r\n`-port` will set the TCP/IP port to listen on (defaults to port 80)\r\n\r\n`-local` controls if the server is only listening on `localhost` (Set true or false, defaults to true)\r\n\r\n`-path` will set the directory to serve files from (defaults to \"www\" in the same directory, can be absolute or relative)\r\n\r\n`-urlpath` will set the url path to export (defaults to \"/\")\r\n\r\n####Example usage:####\r\n\r\n`ssws` will run the server on TCP/IP port 80, will serve files from the directory `www` in the current directory and will only be accessible locally.\r\n\r\n`ssws -port=8080` will run the server on TCP/IP port 8080, will serve files from the directory `www` in the current directory and will only be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/` .\r\n\r\n`ssws -port=8080 -local=false -path=ht_docs` will run the server on TCP/IP port 8080, will serve files from the directory `ht_docs` in the current directory, and will be accessible from all interfaces (depending on firewall and other network configuration).\r\n\r\n`ssws -port=8080 -path=/home/bob/ht_docs -urlpath=files` will run the server on TCP/IP port 8080, will serve files from the directory `/home/bob/ht_docs`, and will only be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/files/` .\r\n\r\n####Downloads####\r\n*~ 1.3MB*\r\n- Linux ([64 bit tar.gz][3] | [32 bit tar.gz][4])\r\n- Windows ([64 bit zip][5] | [32 bit zip][6])\r\n- OSX ([64 bit zip][7] | [32 bit zip][8])\r\n\r\nNOTE: This program has been tested on Windows 8 64bit, and Ubuntu 13.04\r\n\r\n[1]: http://golang.org\r\n[2]: http://python.org\r\n[3]: https://github.com/Intermernet/ssws/blob/master/bin/linux_amd64/ssws_linux_amd64.tar.gz?raw=true\r\n[4]: https://github.com/Intermernet/ssws/blob/master/bin/linux_386/ssws_linux_386.tar.gz?raw=true\r\n[5]: https://github.com/Intermernet/ssws/blob/master/bin/windows_amd64/ssws_windows_amd64.zip?raw=true\r\n[6]: https://github.com/Intermernet/ssws/blob/master/bin/windows_386/ssws_windows_386.zip?raw=true\r\n[7]: https://github.com/Intermernet/ssws/blob/master/bin/darwin_amd64/ssws_darwin_amd64.zip?raw=true\r\n[8]: https://github.com/Intermernet/ssws/blob/master/bin/darwin_386/ssws_darwin_386.zip?raw=true","google":"UA-41203083-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
